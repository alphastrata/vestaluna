# TODO:
- get all the .xml urls that're an option from the NASA API database *note: you want the equiretangulars

```
Art:
- get tiles onto some geometry (UE5?) or Unity? or Godot, which has go bindings...
- investigate the gallery at `8000` on localhost re that github question you posted
- investigate pipeline from big texture onto shpereical geometry (blender?) (ue5)?

Data:
- impl a reader for a database-like for all those WMTSCaps.xml files ey... where are they gonna live?
- test that the scraper works on scraping tiles from any of the .xml formats provided by the NASA Api
- scrape the WMTS nasa db -- at least so you can get em on the fly.

Optimisation:
- investigate non rectangular (w==h*2) dataset concat problems
- investigate the concat not being able to fit everything into ram...
- seperate the xml parsing and the scraper, the scraper can go into tools/scraper.go
- get the width/height/row/col numbers from the api for the concatenator in tools/tools.go


# DONE:
- investgate a simple gocv viewer?
- fix concat ordering problem
- install ue5 on linux
- fixed the open-files limit on the wmts.go scraper
- reimplement smart concat helpers in `tools.go`
- found the `map` issue you're having in `tools.go`
- fixed up README.md so it's almost serviceable
- started breakout files into proper packages and dir structure
- fixed simple concat to work -- ordering is still a mess..

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT 
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
