## TODO:
- Need Docs to support >>> `godoc -http:=6060` then in your browser hit up `http://localhost:6060/pkg/`
- Need to scrape all these for WMTSCapabilities.xml entries... `https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/index.html`
- Need to sort the unresponsive UI when downloading -- or do we keep that?
- Need to address the elephant in the room which is rate-limiting, the NASA api will limit you to 1000 requests per 24 hour period, that's not a lot of tiles considering the amounts the app could try to fetch (42k for example).
- Need a more elegant way to exit.
- Need a more elegant way to set the download path -- maybe a user wants their stitched results to go to ~/Pictures for example.
- Needs a code review from other eyes..
- UI code needs to be broken out into its own thing.
- build instructions for cutting a binary the Fyne way.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Requirements:

1. _This_ repo: `git clone https://github.com/alphastrata/vestaluna`.
2. Golang >= 1.18
3. A working internet connection (for `go mod` to work), and for the app too.
4. Some cmdline/terminal proficiency.
5. A browser, if you're wanting to read documentation generated by godoc.

- `NOTE:You may need to restart your machine/relogin to your shell (depending on your os). `

## Building:

- `go mod tidy`
- `go build main.go`

## Usage:

- `./main` (after you've built it) or,
- `go run main.go` (if you want to build and run)


## Testing:
From your terminal of choice:

- `go test -v` (you can omit the `-v` flag if you're only wanting to see failing tests)
NOTE: there are no tests...

# DONE:
- fix concat ordering problem
- fixed simple concat to work -- ordering is still a mess..
- fixed the open-files limit on the wmts.go scraper
- fixed up README.md so it's almost serviceable
- found the `map` issue you're having in `tools.go`
- get the width/height/row/col numbers from the api for the concatenator in tools/tools.go
- get tiles onto some geometry (UE5?) or Unity? or Godot, which has go bindings...
- impl a reader for a database-like for all those WMTSCaps.xml files ey... where are they gonna live?
- install ue5 on linux
- investgate a simple gocv viewer?
- investigate non rectangular (w==h*2) dataset concat problems
- investigate pipeline from big texture onto shpereical geometry (blender?) (ue5)?
- investigate the concat not being able to fit everything into ram...
- investigate the gallery at `8000` on localhost re that github question you posted
- reimplement smart concat helpers in `tools.go`
- scrape the WMTS nasa db -- at least so you can get em on the fly.
- seperate the xml parsing and the scraper, the scraper can go into tools/scraper.go
- started breakout files into proper packages and dir structure
- test that the scraper works on scraping tiles from any of the .xml formats provided by the NASA Api
